		The Postmaster Emailer has two parts: <strong>recipients</strong> and <strong>emails</strong>.
	</p>

	<h3>Recipients</h3>
	<p>
		The details of a person or entity. Recipients only have a single field: email address (column name: email_address). However when implementing data import scripts, developers may choose to add arbitrary 
		attributes to recipients. Contact the Web Communications Team for more details on this functionality.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is frequently neccessary to include details of a recipient such as name or email address in the content of an email. In the Postmaster Emailer system, this can be accomplished by adding recipieint attribute placholders to the email content. These placeholders will then be replaced will the specific recipient's attribute value when the email is sent. The attribute placeholders take the form of <strong>&lt;delimiter&gt;attribute name&lt;delimiter&gt;</strong>. The default delimited is !@! but this can be modified on a per
		email basis. Also, you must now the column name of the attribute you wish to use. As metioned above, the column name for the email address attribute is email_address. Consult the developer of your import script
		for the column names of other attributes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recipients are aggregated into named groups called <strong>recipient groups</strong>.
		When creating an email, these groups are how you will define which recipients will
		recieve your email. Important notes about recipient groups:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A recipient can be part of more than one recipient group.</li>
		<li>A recipient can only be present in a recipient group once.</li>
		<li>
			If an email is assigned to go to multiple recipient groups and
			a recipient is in more than one of those recipients groups, the 
			recipient will only receive the email <em>once</em>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Emails</h3>
	<p>
		This details what, when, and how an email will be sent to a set of 
		recipients.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Postmaster Email system has a preview function which allows for a review of
		the content of an email before it is sent out to the specified recipient
		groups. If the preview functionality is activated when an email is created,
		a preview email will be sent out to the specified list of preview recipients 
		<strong>1 hour</strong> before the real email is sent to the recipient groups.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Postmaster Email system is capabale of tracking when a recipient opens an email
		and when a recipient clicks on a link in an email.
	</p>
	<p>
		When an email is sent, the details of that particular send (known as an <strong>instance</strong>)
		are recored.
